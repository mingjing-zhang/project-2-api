"""One-shot script to patch Medium URLs on existing articles by exact title match.

Idempotent — run as many times as you want. Articles not in URL_MAP are left
untouched. Pass `--clear` to set URL to NULL for any article whose title is
mapped to None (used to wipe placeholder URLs we couldn't verify).

Run inside the docker container:
    docker compose exec backend python update_urls.py
